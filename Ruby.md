## I want to write some code that takes an array of numbers, multiplies each item in the array by 3, and returns a new array with the new values. know I should use #map, #each, or #select, but Iâ€™m not sure which one is best -- teach me.
```ruby
array_of_numbers = [1, 2, 3]
array_of_numbers.map { |n| n * 3 }   => [3, 6, 9] #map returns a new array with the block code given. BEST CHOICE if not only!!!

array_of_numbers.each { |n| n * 3 } => [1, 2, 3] #each returns the original object

array_of_numbers.select { |n| n * 3 } => [1, 2, 3] #select returns the original object, and is used to select specific numbers not going thru the loop and selecting each number and multiplying.
```
I tried different approach on select but still didn't get the new array 

```ruby
array_of_numbers.select { |n| n == 1 || 2 || 3 * 3 }  => [1, 2, 3]
```

end

def sum(arg1, arg2);

## What is the most beneficial aspect of TDD?

## Write a function that accepts an array of numbers and a second number. Beginning at index 0, total up the sum of the values of the array until you've met or surpassed the second argument. Return the number of elements required to fulfill the goal. If the goal can't be reached, return 0.
